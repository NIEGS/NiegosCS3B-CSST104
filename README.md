Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am Baron Denver D. Niegos and this is the compilation of my recent activities in Advance Machine Learning CSST104. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing fundamental concepts in data analysis and predictive modeling. From basic exploratory data analysis techniques to advanced time series forecasting methods, each topic is explored in detail with practical examples and code implementations.

Table of Contents:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multiple Linear Regression
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

Linear Regression Description: Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting linear equation that predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, and machine learning.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to linear regression Simple linear regression Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method Implementation in Python with NumPy and scikit-learn

Logistic Regression Description: Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. It is commonly used in binary classification problems, such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, and customer churn prediction.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to logistic regression Binary classification using logistic regression Logistic regression for multi-class classification Implementation in Python with scikit-learn

Multiple Linear Regression Description: Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to the case where there are multiple independent variables. It allows us to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables, taking into account their combined effect on the dependent variable. Multiple linear regression is useful for analyzing complex datasets with multiple predictors.

Topics Covered:

Extension of simple linear regression to multiple predictors Assumptions and interpretation of coefficients Feature scaling and regularization techniques Implementation in Python with scikit-learn

EDA techniques help uncover insights, identify trends, and detect anomalies in the data, providing valuable guidance for subsequent modeling and analysis tasks.

Topics Covered:

Overview of EDA and its importance in data analysis Techniques for summarizing and visualizing data distributions Handling missing data and outliers Correlation analysis and feature engineering Implementation in Python with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Description: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular time series forecasting method that combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components with differencing to model non-stationary time series data. ARIMA models are widely used for predicting future values of time series data, such as stock prices, weather patterns, and demand forecasting.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to time series analysis and forecasting
Components of ARIMA models: AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), Moving Average (MA) 
Parameter selection and model diagnostics Implementation in Python with statsmodels
